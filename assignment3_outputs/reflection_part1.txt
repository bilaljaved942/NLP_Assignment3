Reflection (Part 1):
We applied a hybrid pipeline combining LanguageTool grammar correction (if available)
with POS- and dependency-aware refinements using spaCy. The POS stage handles
conservative, targeted changes: duplicate removal, safe possessive normalization,
insertions of definite article for specific legal nouns, and simple subject-verb
corrections by converting bare present verbs to past where a singular subject
was detected. These edits are conservative to avoid altering legal meaning.
