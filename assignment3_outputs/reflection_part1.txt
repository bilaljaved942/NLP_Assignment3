Reflection (Part 1):
We used a hybrid correction pipeline combining LanguageTool grammar correction
and spaCy-based token cleanup. The first stage automatically fixes spelling,
agreement, and punctuation issues, while the second removes duplicate words,
normalizes possessives, and fixes spacing. This improved readability without
altering legal meaning. Challenges included special legal citations and case
numbers that need conservative handling.
