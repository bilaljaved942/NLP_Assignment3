BONUS PART - VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================

1. VISUALIZATIONS CREATED
--------------------------
✓ PCA Visualization: Shows cases projected onto 2D space using Principal Component Analysis
  - First two components explain 3.0% and 2.8% of variance
  - File: pca_visualization.png

✓ t-SNE Visualization: Shows non-linear dimensionality reduction for better cluster separation
  - Reveals natural groupings in the data
  - File: tsne_visualization.png

✓ Clustered t-SNE: Shows K-means clustering results overlaid on t-SNE projection
  - Optimal clusters: 5 (determined using elbow method)
  - File: tsne_clustered.png

✓ Elbow Curve: Helps determine optimal number of clusters
  - File: elbow_curve.png

✓ Similarity Heatmap: Shows pairwise similarities between cases
  - Displays subset of 30 cases
  - File: similarity_heatmap.png

2. CLUSTER ANALYSIS
-------------------
Number of clusters identified: 5

Cluster Distribution:
  Cluster 1: 35 cases (21.2%)
  Cluster 2: 29 cases (17.6%)
  Cluster 3: 37 cases (22.4%)
  Cluster 4: 34 cases (20.6%)
  Cluster 5: 30 cases (18.2%)


3. INSIGHTS FROM VISUALIZATIONS
--------------------------------
• PCA Visualization: The first two principal components capture the most significant
  variations in case embeddings. Cases that are close together in PCA space share
  similar semantic content.

• t-SNE Visualization: Provides better separation of clusters compared to PCA.
  Distinct groups visible in t-SNE plot represent cases with very similar legal
  issues, terminology, or procedural contexts.

• Clustering: K-means identified 5 natural groups in the data. Cases within
  the same cluster likely deal with similar legal domains (e.g., criminal appeals,
  civil disputes, constitutional matters).

• Similarity Patterns: The heatmap reveals that certain cases have very high
  similarity (bright colors), indicating they may be related appeals, similar
  offenses, or cases citing the same legal precedents.

4. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
--------------------------
These visualizations enable:
• Quick identification of case clusters by legal domain
• Visual exploration of the case similarity space
• Understanding of embedding quality and data distribution
• Interactive querying through the CLI interface

5. INTERACTIVE FEATURES
------------------------
The command-line interface allows:
• Querying any case to find similar cases
• Viewing cluster memberships
• Exploring case relationships interactively
• Testing retrieval system with custom queries
